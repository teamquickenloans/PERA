# PERA - Parking Expense Reconciliation and Allocation
The github repository for the "Parking Expense Reconciliation and Allocation" System

Version 1

# Workflow
The master branch is designated as the latest stable version of the PERA site.  Although functionality is limited at this stage in development, code pushed to this branch should *always* build/compile, and should not break previously working functionality of the site.  The "develop" branch of the site is designated as the development branch.  Relatively stable code can be pushed to this branch in order to share with other developers branches.  

## Before Developing
Anytime you start to develop, you should do git pull from develop before doing any coding.  This will help to prevent merge conflicts and will ensure that your code is compatible with any recent updates to the dashboard.
